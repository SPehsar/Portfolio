# This is to give some information about activities that I did during creating this Portfolio. The following is the list of those activities.

# You can see a PDF version of this README file under the project folder: 
https://github.com/SPehsar/Portfolio/blob/master/README.pdf
# •	I started by creating a boilerplate and repository on GitHub to kick-start.
# •	Then I sectionized the one page that I was planning to use according to the wireframe that can be seen under this project folder and PDF file.

# •	Next, I populate each section with proper HTML tags.
# •	In addition, some images were created to be used.  I also created animated GIF files that show some of the projects in functionalities.
# •	I also created a logo for the page and tried to be faithful to the color of the logo for coloring the elements.  
#   In addition to the main webpages, colors are gray and white.
# •	The next step was to create a folder structure to be organized. 
# •	I also created empty stylesheet and JavaScript files as the placeholder to be completed later.
# •	I added HTML pages as they were necessary.
# •	At this step, I started to put entries on the stylesheet.
# •	I also started creating an account for email communication.
# •	I coded the JavaScript file accordingly. 
# •	After being satisfied with the result, I decided to have a second page for the contact form and address to my resume.
# •	The wireframe for that page can be seen in the project folder and PDF file.

# •	I linked this page to the previous page.
# •	I also made sure that email could be sent using this page.
# •	The reason for this page was to provide users with a link to my resume.  (FYI – my resume location may change in future). 
#   To make it more suitable for mobile devices, I also created a QR code, so people can easily scan the code and get the resume on the screen of #   their mobile device.

# I made sure that all these pages were responsive accordingly.

# To view this page, you can go to: https://cyrus-portfolio.netlify.app/index.html#aboutMe

# To use this code, you need to get your needed codes for email connections. In addition, you need to get the QR code for your resume.  
# Due to #privacy concerns, I have removed anything that is private.
